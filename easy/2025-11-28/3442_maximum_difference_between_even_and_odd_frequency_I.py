'''You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.'''


class Solution:
    def maxDifference(self, s: str) -> int:
        cnt = Counter(s)

        even_freq = float('inf')
        odd_freq = float('-inf')

        for val in cnt.values():
            if val % 2 == 0:
                if val < even_freq:
                    even_freq = val
            else:
                if val > odd_freq:
                    odd_freq = val

        max_dif = odd_freq - even_freq

        return max_dif
