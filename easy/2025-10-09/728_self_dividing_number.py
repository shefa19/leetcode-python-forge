# A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

# For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
# A self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

# Given two integers left and right, return a list of all the self-dividing numbers in the range [left, right] (both inclusive).

 

# Example 1:

# Input: left = 1, right = 22
# Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,22]
# Example 2:

# Input: left = 47, right = 85
# Output: [48,55,66,77]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= left <= right <= 104


result = []

for i in range(left, right+1):
    temp = i
    app = True
    while temp != 0:
        rem = temp % 10
        if rem == 0 or i % rem != 0:
            app = False
            break
        temp //= 10
    if app:
        result.append(i)

return result
