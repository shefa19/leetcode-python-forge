# You are given positive integers n and m.

# Define two integers as follows:

# num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
# num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.
# Return the integer num1 - num2.


# Example 1:

# Input: n = 10, m = 3
# Output: 19
# Explanation: In the given example:
# - Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
# - Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
# We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.

class Solution:
    def differenceOfSums(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        num1 = num2 = 0
        for num in range(1, n+1):
            if num % m != 0:
                num1 += num
            else:
                num2 += num
                
        return num1 - num2
